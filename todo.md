# To-do

- [ ] Input field validation and error messaging
- [ ] Uh, make it look nice?
- [ ] When all field are filled (except if disabled?) appear "Tweet" button
- [ ] Figure out how to encode line breaks in query string
- [ ] Figure out way for user to add URL, autopopulating creator and work fields for common domains (youtube, spotify, etc. - sometimes this info is somewhat standardized on page)
